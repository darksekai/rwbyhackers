  <H1>Phenomenal Woman</h1>
    <h2>by Maya Angelou</h2>
    <p>
    Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.<br>
    I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size<br>
    But when I start to tell them,<br>
    They think I'm telling lies.<br>
    I say,<br>
    It's in the reach of my arms<br>
    The span of my hips,<br>
    The stride of my step,<br>
    The curl of my lips.<br>
    I'm a woman<br>
    Phenomenally.<br>
    Phenomenal woman,<br>
    That's me.<br>
  </p>
    <p>
    I walk into a room<br>
    Just as cool as you please,<br>
    And to a man,<br>
    The fellows stand or<br>
    Fall down on their knees.<br>
    Then they swarm around me,<br>
    A hive of honey bees.<br>
    I say,<br>
    It's the fire in my eyes,<br>
    And the flash of my teeth,<br>
    The swing in my waist,<br>
    And the joy in my feet.<br>
    I'm a woman<br>
    Phenomenally.<br>
    Phenomenal woman,<br>
    That's me.<br>
  </p>
    <p>
    Men themselves have wondered<br>
    What they see in me.<br>
    They try so much<br>
    But they can't touch<br>
    My inner mystery.<br>
    When I try to show them<br>
    They say they still can't see.<br>
    I say,<br>
    It's in the arch of my back,<br>
    The sun of my smile,<br>
    The ride of my breasts,<br>
    The grace of my style.<br>
    I'm a woman<br>
  </p>
    <p>
    Phenomenally.<br>
    Phenomenal woman,<br>
    That's me.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now you understand<br>
    Just why my head's not bowed.<br>
    I don't shout or jump about<br>
    Or have to talk real loud.<br>
    When you see me passing<br>
    It ought to make you proud.<br>
    I say,<br>
    It's in the click of my heels,<br>
    The bend of my hair,<br>
    the palm of my hand,<br>
    The need of my care,<br>
    'Cause I'm a woman<br>
    Phenomenally.<br>
    Phenomenal woman,<br>
    That's me.<br>
  </p>
